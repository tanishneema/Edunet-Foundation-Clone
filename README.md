# Front-end Design for Edunet Foundation

This project is a front-end design for Edunet Foundation, created during my internship in front-end development. The website consists of two pages: Home and About Us.

## Technology Used

The project was developed using HTML and CSS. The website is responsive, which means it adjusts to the screen size of different devices. JavaScript was also used for certain functionalities like automatic blog changes.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project was to create a clone website for Edunet Foundation. The goal was to improve their existing website by making it more beautiful, user-friendly, and functional.

## Project Description

The website is designed to be visually appealing and easy to navigate. The Home page features a slideshow of images, highlighting the various initiatives of Edunet Foundation. The page also includes a brief description of the organization's mission and goals.

The navigation bar is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing users to easily switch between the Home and About Us pages. The horizontal scroll cards on the home page provide quick access to different sections of the website.

One of the unique features of the website is the automatic changing blogs of people associated with the organization. This is implemented using JavaScript and provides an easy way for visitors to stay up-to-date with the latest news and updates from Edunet Foundation.

The About Us page provides detailed information about the organization, including its history, team, and accomplishments. The page also includes a contact form for users to reach out to the organization.

In addition to its functional features, the website also boasts a variety of design elements. The hover effect content vision provides users with an interactive experience as they explore the different sections of the website.
